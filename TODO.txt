Notes/ideas:
	-right now there isn't too much clarity regarding showing how fast mom is going, could be fixed with a background
	
TODO:
	-Either adjust the timer so that it's less time, or make mom slower a bit or something.
	-Make main menu options and stuff selector or something
	-Make a better pause screen, wit a slightly transparent bg or something
	-FINISH ADDING IN RETARD
	-FINISH ADDING IN SPIDER
	-Modify the angle at which the normal walking transitions to stumbling
	-Tweak the controls better
	-Fix mom tip drag and stuff
	-Fix cat spawn shit
	-Maybe get some randomization going? Not sure if stuff is confirmed yet
	-replace points with a timer
	-add a simple highscore thing for finishing and timer
	

DONE?:
	-Have some indicator that shows slo mo mode and indicates when it's about to end
	-Fix the player position properly
	-Add end state that game goes to once rope breaks.
	-Fix mom hitbox, so that the cat interacts with the dynamic hitbox properly
	-Make candy pop up a bit, or have a better indicator of it coming to you
