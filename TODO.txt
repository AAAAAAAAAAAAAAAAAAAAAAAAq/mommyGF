	-Fix cat spawn shit
	-Maybe get some randomization going? Not sure if stuff is confirmed yet
	-replace points with a timer
	-add a simple highscore thing for finishing and timer
	-make it so when game is paused, the nape physics aren't still updating
	-Cheat Code system?
	


DONE?:
	-Have some indicator that shows slo mo mode and indicates when it's about to end
	-Fix the player position properly
	-Add end state that game goes to once rope breaks.
	-Fix mom hitbox, so that the cat interacts with the dynamic hitbox properly
	-Make candy pop up a bit, or have a better indicator of it coming to you
	-Rewrite controls code
	-Maybe swap the smack to another left button? like left to switch, then left to smack
	-removed points
	-Make a better pause screen, wit a slightly transparent bg or something
	-Modify the angle at which the normal walking transitions to stumbling
	-right now there isn't too much clarity regarding showing how fast mom is going, could be fixed with a background
