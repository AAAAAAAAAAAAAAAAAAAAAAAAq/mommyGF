Notes/ideas:
	-Maybe adjust the timer so that it's less time, or make mom slower a bit or something.
	-make it so that the player bounces as usual
	
	fix the wavs?

	get the map select stuff all sorted out
	make the slo mo hits feel more impactful
	
	I think more enemies would benefit gameplay, but only to the point where it
	doesn't get overwhelming, and to keep pacing and shit. I think we need to balance
	out the timings of the enemies
	
	For some reason in the windows build, the cats sprite is loading as a black square
