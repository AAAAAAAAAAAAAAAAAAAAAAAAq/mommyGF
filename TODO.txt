	Quality of Life updates:
		in the anvil state, make it so you can pretty much spam buttons
	
	-Maybe get some area randomization going
	-make it so when game is paused, the nape physics aren't still updating
	-Cheat Code system? Make it text based for more reliability on mobile
	-Better transition between playstate and anvil state
	-cleanup the PlayerAnims class to make it more versatile with more misc animations, but in the end I might just scrap it

	-get a mobile build up and running
