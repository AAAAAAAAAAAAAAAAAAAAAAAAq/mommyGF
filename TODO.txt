Notes/ideas:
	-Maybe adjust the timer so that it's less time, or make mom slower a bit or something.
	
TODO:
	
	-Maybe get some area randomization going? Not sure if stuff is confirmed yet
	-redo the spritesheets so that they are smaller in size and shit
	-add a simple highscore thing for finishing and timer
	-make it so when game is paused, the nape physics aren't still updating
	-Cheat Code system? Make it text based for more reliability on mobile
	-Better transition between playstate and anvil state
	-cleanup the PlayerAnims class to make it more versatile with more misc animations, but in the end I might just scrap it
	once i get final designs
	-cats have a set break for candy, about 5 or so
	-Make main menu options and stuff selector or something
	-fix cat hitting mom and something so that it's equal to one mom hit
	-add in the smear shit
	-add in mom getting anvil dropped on her
	-start prototyping random outside stuff
	
	Today's TODO:
		get a mobile build up and running
DONE?:
	-mom moving more aggresively/unpredictably
